# Solar Cell Company

## Description
This is a Frappe-based application designed to calculate power consumption and determine the Return on Investment (ROI) for clients switching to solar energy. The system processes power consumption records collected per hour (KWH) and every 15 minutes (KW) to compute key metrics that help in financial decision-making.

### Features
- **Average Consumption Calculation:** Computes the average KW and KWH for all records or within a specified date range.
- **Tariff-Based Pricing:** Calculates low and high tariffs based on specific time periods:
  - **Low Tariff Period:** 11:00 PM - 5:59 AM (charged at 10% of average KWH)
  - **High Tariff Period:** 6:00 AM - 10:59 PM (charged at 30% of average KWH)
  
- **Customer-Specific ROI Entries:**
  - Entries can be created for each customer at any time.
  - Sales teams can create and edit entries.
  - Accounting teams have read-only access.
- **Data Management:** Ensures all relevant fields from imported datasets (e.g., Excel files) are included in the calculations.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Restricts access based on user roles.
